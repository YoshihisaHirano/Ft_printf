# Ft_printf
A 21 school (ecole 42 branch) curriculum project.
The aim of the project was to recreate the behaviour of standard C library function - printf. This implementation handles only the following types: '%d', '%i', '%u', '%x', '%X', '%p', '%c', '%s', '%n' and the following flags: '0', ' ', '-', '+', '#', precision and width are also implemented.
